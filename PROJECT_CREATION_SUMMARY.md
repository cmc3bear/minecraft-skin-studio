I've created a comprehensive project plan for **Minecraft Skin Studio**, a Claude-enabled Minecraft skin developer designed for your daughter Olive. The project structure emphasizes safety, usability, and educational value.

## Created Documents

1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - High-level vision and features
2. **PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements  
3. **minecraft_skin_studio_plan.json** - Complete development plan with milestones
4. **minecraft_skin_studio_plan.md** - Human-readable development plan

## Key Project Features

### Core Functionality
- **Visual Pixel Editor**: 64x64 grid with kid-friendly drawing tools
- **AI Assistant**: Claude integration for natural language skin creation
- **3D Preview**: Real-time Three.js preview with animations

### Risk Mitigation
- **Critical**: AI safety and data privacy protections
- **High**: Performance optimization for school devices
- **Medium**: Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Success Metrics
- Time to first skin creation: < 5 minutes
- AI safety rate: 100% appropriate responses
- Parent satisfaction: > 90% approval
- Device compatibility: 95% of target devices
- Offline functionality: 100% core features

## Next Steps

1. **Create Local Project Instance**: Set up a dedicated Claude instance in the minecraft-skin-studio directory
2. **Initialize Repository**: Create GitHub repo with the planned structure
3. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with foundation and architecture milestone
4. **Set Up CI/CD**: Implement the development pipeline
5. **Start Development**: Follow the milestone plan systematically

## Technologies Chosen

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Three.js, Canvas API, Vite
- **AI**: Claude API with content filtering
- **Storage**: IndexedDB, LocalStorage, optional cloud sync
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify, PWA, GitHub Actions

The project is designed to be developed incrementally, with each milestone building on the previous one. The plan prioritizes safety and usability while maintaining technical excellence throughout.
