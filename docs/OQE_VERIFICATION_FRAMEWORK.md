# Operational Quality Engineering (OQE) Verification Framework

## Core Principle
Every agent action must be verifiable, traceable, and demonstrably aligned with the master plan through concrete test plans and measurable outcomes.

## 1. Master Plan Alignment Verification

### Master Plan Definition
```yaml
Master Plan: Minecraft Skin Studio
Vision: Safe, performant, AI-powered skin creator for children
Key Objectives:
  1. Zero safety incidents (Guardian)
  2. 60+ FPS performance (PixelPerfect)
  3. <3s AI responses (Tensor)
  4. Zero security vulnerabilities (CloudShield)
  5. WCAG AA accessibility (Professor UX)

Success Criteria:
  - 1M+ child users within Year 1
  - Zero safety incidents ever
  - 99.9% uptime
  - 4.5+ parent satisfaction
```

### Alignment Verification Matrix
```typescript
interface AlignmentVerification {
  agentAction: {
    agent: string;
    action: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    changeSet: ChangeSet;
  };
  
  masterPlanAlignment: {
    objective: string;
    contribution: 'direct' | 'indirect' | 'neutral' | 'negative';
    measurementBefore: number;
    projectedAfter: number;
    evidence: string[];
  };
  
  verification: {
    testPlan: TestPlan;
    executionResults: TestResults;
    metricsImpact: MetricsImpact;
    approved: boolean;
  };
}

// Example: Guardian blocks inappropriate word
{
  agentAction: {
    agent: 'Guardian',
    action: 'Block word "damn" in user input',
    timestamp: '2024-01-20T10:30:00Z',
    changeSet: { 
      file: 'src/filters/profanity.ts',
      additions: 1,
      deletions: 0
    }
  },
  masterPlanAlignment: {
    objective: 'Zero safety incidents',
    contribution: 'direct',
    measurementBefore: 0,  // incidents
    projectedAfter: 0,     // maintained
    evidence: [
      'Word is mild profanity',
      'Not appropriate for 7-12 age group',
      'Parent complaints likely if allowed'
    ]
  },
  verification: {
    testPlan: profanityFilterTestPlan,
    executionResults: { passed: 50, failed: 0 },
    metricsImpact: { safetyScore: '+0.01%' },
    approved: true
  }
}
```

## 2. Agent Action Test Plans

### Guardian Test Plan Template
```yaml
Test Plan: Guardian Content Filter
Purpose: Verify content filtering aligns with child safety objectives

Pre-conditions:
  - Test dataset of 10,000 inputs (benign and problematic)
  - Age-appropriate content guidelines
  - Parent feedback database

```

## 3. Verification Execution Framework

### Automated Verification Pipeline
```typescript
class OQEVerificationPipeline {
  async verifyAgentAction(action: AgentAction): Promise<VerificationResult> {
    // Step 1: Master Plan Alignment Check
    const alignment = await this.checkAlignment(action);
    if (alignment.contribution === 'negative') {
      return this.reject(action, 'Conflicts with master plan');
    }
    
    // Step 2: Load Relevant Test Plan
    const testPlan = await this.loadTestPlan(action.agent, action.type);
    
    // Step 3: Execute Pre-condition Checks
    const preConditions = await this.verifyPreConditions(testPlan);
    if (!preConditions.passed) {
      return this.reject(action, 'Pre-conditions not met');
    }
    
    // Step 4: Execute Test Cases
    const testResults = await this.executeTests(testPlan, action);
    
    // Step 5: Verify Success Criteria
    const success = this.verifyCriteria(testResults, testPlan.criteria);
    
    // Step 6: Measure Impact
    const impact = await this.measureImpact(action, testResults);
    
    // Step 7: Generate Evidence
    const evidence = this.generateEvidence(
      alignment,
      testResults,
      impact
    );
    
    return {
      approved: success && alignment.positive && impact.positive,
      action,
      alignment,
      testResults,
      impact,
      evidence,
      certificate: this.generateCertificate(evidence)
    };
  }
}
```

### Test Execution Engine
```typescript
interface TestExecutionEngine {
  // Isolated test environment
  environment: {
    type: 'isolated' | 'staging' | 'canary';
    state: 'clean' | 'production-mirror';
    data: 'synthetic' | 'anonymized-real';
  };
  
  // Execution strategy
  strategy: {
    parallel: boolean;
    timeout: number;
    retries: number;
    failFast: boolean;
  };
  
  // Measurement tools
  measurements: {
    performance: PerformanceProfiler;
    security: SecurityScanner;
    behavior: BehaviorValidator;
    regression: RegressionDetector;
  };
  
  // Evidence collection
  evidence: {
    screenshots: boolean;
    videos: boolean;
    logs: LogLevel;
    metrics: MetricCollector;
    traces: TraceCollector;
  };
}
```

## 4. Continuous Verification Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```yaml
Agent Effectiveness KPIs:
  Guardian:
    - Incidents Prevented: Target = âˆž
    - False Positive Rate: Target < 1%
    - Response Time: Target < 100ms
    - Coverage: Target = 100%
    
  PixelPerfect:
    - FPS Violations: Target = 0
    - Performance Regressions: Target = 0
    - Memory Leaks: Target = 0
    - User Complaints: Target < 1%
    
  Tensor:
    - Response Time p95: Target < 3s
    - Safety Violations: Target = 0
    - Accuracy: Target > 85%
    - Availability: Target > 99.9%

Master Plan Progress:
  - Safety Score: Current/Target
  - Performance Score: Current/Target
  - User Satisfaction: Current/Target
  - Market Position: Current/Target
```

### Verification Dashboard
```typescript
interface VerificationDashboard {
  realTime: {
    activeVerifications: Verification[];
    pendingActions: AgentAction[];
    recentResults: VerificationResult[];
    blockingIssues: Issue[];
  };
  
  trends: {
    agentEffectiveness: TrendChart;
    masterPlanProgress: ProgressChart;
    verificationVelocity: VelocityChart;
    qualityTrend: QualityChart;
  };
  
  compliance: {
    testCoverage: number;  // Must be 100%
    planAdherence: number; // Must be 100%
    evidenceQuality: number; // Must be >95%
    auditReadiness: 'ready' | 'gaps';
  };
}
```

## 5. Evidence Chain of Custody

### Evidence Requirements
```typescript
interface EvidencePackage {
  // Immutable record
  id: UUID;
  timestamp: Date;
  hash: SHA256;
  
  // Action details
  action: {
    agent: string;
    description: string;
    changeset: Diff;
    rationale: string;
  };
  
  // Verification proof
  verification: {
    testPlan: TestPlan;
    execution: TestExecution;
    results: TestResults;
    artifacts: Artifact[];
  };
  
  // Alignment proof
  alignment: {
    objective: string;
    contribution: MeasuredContribution;
    evidence: string[];
    approval: ApprovalChain;
  };
  
  // Chain of custody
  custody: {
    created: Signature;
    reviewed: Signature[];
    approved: Signature;
    stored: StorageProof;
    blockchain: BlockchainHash;
  };
}
```

### Audit Trail
```yaml
Every Action Tracked:
  1. Agent proposes action
  2. Alignment check performed
  3. Test plan selected
  4. Tests executed
  5. Results verified
  6. Impact measured
  7. Evidence generated
  8. Decision recorded
  9. Action implemented (or rejected)
  10. Post-implementation verification

Queryable By:
  - Agent
  - Time period
  - Objective
  - Result
  - Impact
```

## 6. Corrective Action Protocol

### When Verification Fails
```typescript
class CorrectiveActionProtocol {
  async handleFailure(
    verification: VerificationResult
  ): Promise<CorrectiveAction> {
    if (verification.alignment.contribution === 'negative') {
      // Action conflicts with master plan
      return {
        action: 'reject',
        reason: 'Misaligned with objectives',
        recommendation: 'Review agent configuration',
        escalation: 'Agent owner'
      };
    }
    
    if (verification.testResults.failed > 0) {
      // Tests failed
      return {
        action: 'fix',
        reason: `${verification.testResults.failed} tests failed`,
        recommendation: 'Fix failing tests before retry',
        escalation: 'Development team'
      };
    }
    
    if (verification.impact.negative) {
      // Negative impact predicted
      return {
        action: 'redesign',
        reason: 'Predicted negative impact',
        recommendation: 'Find alternative approach',
        escalation: 'Technical lead'
      };
    }
  }
}
```
