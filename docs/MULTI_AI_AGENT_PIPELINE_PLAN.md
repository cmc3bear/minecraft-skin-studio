# Agent-Driven Development Pipeline Implementation Plan
*Integrating Claude and Specialized Quality Agents*

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an agent-driven development pipeline for Minecraft Skin Studio. The pipeline focuses on development automation using Claude for code assistance and specialized quality agents (Guardian, Tensor, PixelPerfect, CloudShield) for domain-specific quality assurance. ChatGPT integration is reserved for studio features (user creativity assistance) rather than development pipeline operations.

   }
   ```

2. **Task Classification**
   - **Creative Tasks** → ChatGPT (skin design, color schemes)
   - **Code Tasks** → Claude (refactoring, architecture, reviews)
   - **Safety Tasks** → Guardian Agent (content filtering, COPPA)
   - **Performance Tasks** → PixelPerfect Agent (optimization)
   - **AI Tasks** → Tensor Agent (model integration, responses)

3. **Cross-Agent Communication**

     participatingAgents: AgentId[];
     consensusRequirements: ConsensusRule[];
     crossAgentEvidence: EvidenceCorrelation[];
     conflictResolutionTests: ConflictTestCase[];
   }
   ```

2. **Evidence Correlation**
   - Cross-reference evidence from different agents
   - Detect inconsistencies and conflicts
   - Generate comprehensive verification reports
   - Cryptographic attestation from multiple sources

3. **Consensus Verification**
   - Critical decisions require 2+ agent agreement
   - Safety decisions require Guardian + 1 other agent
   - Performance claims verified by PixelPerfect + measurements
   - Creative decisions validated by user testing + ChatGPT analysis

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ Multi-agent evidence correlation 100% accurate
- ✅ Consensus decisions have 95% user satisfaction
- ✅ Conflict detection and resolution <1 minute
- ✅ Evidence authenticity cryptographically verified
