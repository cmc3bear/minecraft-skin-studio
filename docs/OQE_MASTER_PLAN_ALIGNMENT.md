## Alignment Verification Protocol

### 1. Change Classification System
```typescript
enum ChangeImpact {
  CRITICAL_POSITIVE = "Directly advances Level 1 objective",
  CORE_POSITIVE = "Directly advances Level 2 objective",
  GROWTH_POSITIVE = "Directly advances Level 3 objective",
  NEUTRAL = "No direct impact on objectives",
  MINOR_NEGATIVE = "Slight regression, acceptable trade-off",
  MAJOR_NEGATIVE = "Significant regression, requires justification",
  BLOCKING = "Violates critical objective, must be rejected"
}

interface ChangeAlignment {
  change: {
    id: string;
    description: string;
    agent: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    code: CodeDiff;
  };
  
  classification: ChangeImpact;
  
  objectiveImpact: {
    objective: string;
    currentMetric: number;
    projectedMetric: number;
    evidence: string[];
    confidence: number; // 0-100%
  }[];
  
  verification: {
    testResults: TestResult[];
    performanceImpact: PerformanceProfile;
    securityImpact: SecurityAssessment;
    userImpact: UserExperienceProjection;
  };
  
  decision: {
    approved: boolean;
    rationale: string;
    conditions?: string[];
    followUp?: Action[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Objective Impact Measurement

```

### 3. Multi-Objective Trade-off Analysis

```typescript

  analyzeChange(change: Change): TradeOffAnalysis {
    const impacts = this.measureAllObjectives(change);
    
    // Critical objectives are non-negotiable
    for (const critical of impacts.criticalObjectives) {
      if (critical.impact < 0) {
        return {
          decision: 'REJECT',
          reason: `Violates critical objective: ${critical.objective}`,
          evidence: critical.evidence
        };
      }
    }
    
    // Calculate weighted score for other objectives
    const score = impacts.reduce((total, impact) => {
      return total + (impact.value * impact.weight);
    }, 0);
    
    return {
      decision: score > 0 ? 'APPROVE' : 'REVIEW',
      score,
      breakdown: impacts,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(impacts)
