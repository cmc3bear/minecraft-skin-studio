# Evidence Collection Methods

## Objective Metrics (Quantitative)
```javascript
// Performance Evidence
const performanceEvidence = {
  fps: dirtyRectManager.getFPS(), // Must be ‚â•60
  frameTime: dirtyRectManager.getMetrics().averageRenderTime, // Must be <16.67ms
  memoryGrowth: performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize, // Must be stable
  passed: fps >= 60 && frameTime < 16.67
};

// Accessibility Evidence  
const accessibilityEvidence = {
  axeViolations: await axe.run(), // Must be 0
  keyboardNavigable: testKeyboardNavigation(), // Must be 100%
  screenReaderCompatible: testScreenReaders(), // Must pass 3+ readers
  passed: axeViolations.length === 0
};

// COPPA Evidence
const coppaEvidence = {
  ageGateBlocks: testUnder13Registration(), // Must block 100%
  parentConsentWorks: testConsentFlow(), // Must capture consent
  dataDeleteWorks: testDataDeletion(), // Must complete <30 days
  passed: ageGateBlocks && parentConsentWorks
};

// Security Evidence
const securityEvidence = {
  headersPresent: checkSecurityHeaders(), // All required headers
  apiKeysProtected: scanForExposedKeys(), // Must be 0
  vulnerabilities: runSecurityScan(), // 0 high/critical
  passed: headersPresent && apiKeysProtected && vulnerabilities === 0
};
```

## Qualitative Assessment
```typescript
interface QualitativeEvidence {
  codeReviewPassed: boolean; // Peer review approval
  documentationComplete: boolean; // All docs updated
  userTestingFeedback: string[]; // User acceptance testing
  legalApproval: boolean; // Legal sign-off for COPPA
  architectureApproved: boolean; // Architecture review passed
}
```

# Task Classification by Design Phase

## Conceptual Design Tasks ‚úÖ
- [x] Define requirements
- [x] Create architecture
- [x] Identify risks
- [x] Map capabilities
- [x] Design processes

## Production Design Tasks üîÑ
- [x] Implement performance optimization
- [x] Configure security
- [ ] Implement accessibility
- [ ] Build COPPA compliance
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Create monitoring

## Product Deployment Tasks ‚è≥
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Execute E2E tests
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Validate rollback
- [ ] Deploy to production

# Evidence-Based Progress Tracking

## Current Evidence Score: 35/100

### Breakdown:
- Conceptual Design: 20/20 ‚úÖ
- Production Design: 15/50 üîÑ
  - Performance: 10/10 ‚úÖ
  - Security Config: 5/10 ‚úÖ
  - Accessibility: 0/10 ‚ùå
  - COPPA: 0/10 ‚ùå
  - Headers: 0/10 ‚ùå
- Product Deployment: 0/30 ‚è≥

## Next Evidence Requirements (Priority Order)

### Must Provide Evidence For:
1. **Accessibility ARIA Implementation**
   - Evidence: Modified component files with ARIA attributes
   - Validation: axe-core scan results

2. **COPPA Age Gate**
   - Evidence: Working age verification component
   - Validation: Test showing under-13 block

3. **Security Headers**
   - Evidence: Vite config with headers
   - Validation: curl showing headers in response

# Success Metrics (Evidence-Based)

## NOT This ‚ùå
- "Complete in Week 1"
- "3 days for implementation"
- "Due by Friday"

## But This ‚úÖ
- "Exit criteria: axe scan shows 0 violations"
- "Complete when: FPS consistently ‚â•60 under load"
- "Ready when: Parent consent flow captures verified consent"

# Maturity Progression Rules

## Rule 1: No Time-Based Progression
Progression happens when EVIDENCE is provided, not when time passes

## Rule 2: Evidence Must Be Measurable
Each piece of evidence must have a clear, objective measurement

## Rule 3: Quality Gates Are Mandatory
Cannot proceed to next stage without meeting ALL exit criteria

## Rule 4: Regression Blocks Progression
If evidence shows regression (e.g., FPS drops below 60), must fix before proceeding

# Conclusion

This plan replaces ALL time-based metrics with evidence-based progression. Tasks are classified by their design phase (Conceptual/Production/Deployment), and progress is measured by objective evidence collection, not calendar dates.

**Current Status**: Production Design Phase (35% evidence collected)
**Next Action**: Provide evidence for accessibility implementation
**Blocking Issues**: No evidence for COPPA, accessibility, or security headers
