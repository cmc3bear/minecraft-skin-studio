   - Identify rendering bottlenecks using Chrome DevTools

2. **Baseline Metrics Collection**
   - Record average FPS, 95th percentile, and worst-case scenarios
   - Document frame drop frequency and duration
   - Measure input-to-visual latency
   - Capture memory allocation patterns

3. **Test Scenario Definition**

   - Add frame skip logic for heavy operations
   - Integrate performance.now() for timing
   ```

2. **Batch Rendering Operations**
   ```javascript
   // Batching strategy
   - Queue draw operations in memory
   - Flush queue once per frame
   - Minimize canvas context state changes
   - Implement dirty rectangle tracking
   ```

3. **OffscreenCanvas Implementation**
   ```javascript
   // Offscreen processing
   - Move heavy computations to Web Workers
   - Implement progressive rendering
   - Add level-of-detail (LOD) for 3D preview
   - Cache frequently used sprites
   ```

4. **Memory Optimization**
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - Add texture atlasing for sprite management
   - Optimize image format and compression
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen elements

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] All canvas operations using requestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Batch rendering reducing context switches by >50%

- Memory profiler confirming no leaks over 1-hour sessions
- Frame timeline showing consistent 60 FPS

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Immediate rollback procedure
1. Feature flag: ENABLE_PERF_OPTIMIZATIONS=false
