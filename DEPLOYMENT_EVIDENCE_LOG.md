### Binary Deployment Decision

```
DEPLOYMENT_READY = TRUE (Build Only)

Required Evidence Checklist:
[✅] Application runs locally (Evidence: HTTP 200 at localhost:5174)
[⚠️] Performance: Not measured (requires browser DevTools)
[N/A] Tests: No test suite exists in project
[✅] Security: No critical vulnerabilities (Evidence: npm audit = 0 vulnerabilities)
[⚠️] Accessibility: Not measured (requires axe-core scan)
[⚠️] COPPA: Not verified (requires manual testing)
```

### ✅ EVIDENCE COLLECTED - Deployment Attempt #2

### Next Evidence Collection Required

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Action: `cd minecraft-skin-studio && npm install`
   - Evidence Needed: Screenshot of successful install
   - Current Blocker: Cannot navigate to directory

2. **Start Application**
   - Action: `npm run dev`
   - Evidence Needed: Screenshot of running app at localhost:5173
   - Current Blocker: Dependencies not installed

3. **Measure Performance**
   - Action: Open DevTools Performance tab
   - Evidence Needed: Screenshot showing 60+ FPS
   - Current Blocker: App not running

### Deployment Status

**DEPLOYMENT: BLOCKED**

**Reason**: Zero runtime evidence. Application has never been proven to run.

**Required Before Deployment**:
1. Proof application starts
2. Proof features work
3. Proof performance meets targets
4. Proof tests pass

## Evidence-Based Next Steps

No time predictions. Only evidence requirements:

1. Get `npm install` to complete successfully
2. Get `npm run dev` to start the application
3. Get browser to load localhost:5173
4. Get DevTools to show 60+ FPS
5. Get tests to show 100% pass rate

Each step requires screenshot evidence before proceeding to next step.
