# PMO Compliance Report: Codex Minecraft Skin Studio
**Report Date:** 2025-08-10  
**PMO Review Type:** Architecture & Process Compliance  
**Baseline Standard:** project-boilerplate v1.0

## Executive Summary

**Compliance Score: 42/100** ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

Critical deviations from project-baseline methodology detected. Project requires immediate remediation to meet organizational standards.

## 1. Architecture Compliance Assessment

### ❌ Evidence-Based Development
**Standard:** All capabilities must have binary proof (works/doesn't work)  
**Finding:** Project lacks evidence collection framework
- **Missing:** No evidence/ directory structure
- **Missing:** No capability verification agents
- **Missing:** No regression detection system
- **Recommendation:** Implement project-boilerplate evidence collectors

### ❌ Agent-Based Validation
**Standard:** Specialized agents verify each capability  
**Finding:** Only 5 review agents, no verification agents
- **Has:** Review agents (Guardian, PixelPerfect, etc.)
- **Missing:** Capability verification agents
- **Missing:** Evidence collection agents
- **Recommendation:** Create agents following baseline templates

### ❌ Binary State Tracking
**Standard:** Features tracked as PROVEN/NOT_PROVEN  
**Finding:** Using percentage-based metrics (74.2% health)
- **Violation:** Health scores are estimates, not evidence
- **Required:** Binary gates (YES/NO) only
- **Recommendation:** Replace all percentage metrics with binary proof

## 2. Process Compliance Assessment

### ❌ Documentation Standards
**Standard:** BASELINE_CRITERIA.md required for all projects  
**Finding:** Missing critical compliance documents
- **Missing:** BASELINE_CRITERIA.md
- **Missing:** EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENTS.md
- **Missing:** REGRESSION_TRACKING.md
- **Has:** PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md (non-standard format)

### ⚠️ Testing Methodology
**Standard:** Evidence-based testing with proof artifacts  
**Finding:** No test suite exists
- **Critical Gap:** Cannot prove any capability works
- **Required:** Test evidence in evidence/ directory
- **Recommendation:** Implement baseline test framework

### ❌ Deployment Criteria
**Standard:** Binary deployment gates with evidence  
**Finding:** Using time-based planning
- **Violation:** "Week 1, Week 2" planning found
- **Required:** Evidence-based progression only
- **Recommendation:** Remove all time predictions

## 3. Evidence Collection Gaps

### Required Evidence Not Collected:
1. **Performance Evidence**
   - Required: Screenshot of 60+ FPS
   - Actual: No DevTools screenshots exist
   
2. **Feature Evidence**
   - Required: Screenshot/video of each feature working
   - Actual: No feature proof collected
   
3. **Test Evidence**
   - Required: Test execution logs
   - Actual: No test suite exists

4. **User Evidence**
   - Required: Proof of user interaction
   - Actual: No usage logs collected

## 4. Recommendations for Compliance

### IMMEDIATE (Blocking):
1. **Create BASELINE_CRITERIA.md**
   ```markdown
   # Baseline Criteria
   ## Current Capabilities (PROVEN)
   - [List with evidence references]
   ## Next Milestone (Evidence Required)
   - [Binary success criteria]
   ```

2. **Implement Evidence Collection**
   ```javascript
   // Required in every component
   class EvidenceCollector {
     captureProof(capability, result) {
       // Store binary proof
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Remove Time-Based Planning**
   - Delete all "Week X" references
   - Replace with evidence requirements

### SHORT-TERM (Critical):
1. **Add Regression Detection**
   - Import from project-boilerplate
   - Track capability degradation

2. **Create Verification Agents**
   - One agent per critical capability
   - Binary output only (PASS/FAIL)

3. **Standardize Documentation**
   - Use baseline templates
   - Evidence-based reporting only

## 5. Compliance Tracking

### Current State vs. Required State

| Component | Current | Required | Gap |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| Evidence Framework | 0% | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Binary Tracking | 0% | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Verification Agents | 0% | 100% | CRITICAL |
| Documentation Standards | 30% | 100% | HIGH |
| Test Evidence | 0% | 100% | CRITICAL |

## 6. PMO Directives

### Mandatory Actions:
1. **STOP** using percentage-based health scores
2. **STOP** time-based planning
3. **START** collecting binary evidence
4. **START** using baseline templates
5. **IMPLEMENT** evidence-based progression

### Compliance Deadline:
No deadline. Compliance proven when evidence shows:
- [ ] BASELINE_CRITERIA.md exists
- [ ] Evidence collection operational
- [ ] Binary tracking implemented
- [ ] Verification agents deployed
- [ ] Documentation standardized

## 7. Project-Specific Adaptations Allowed

While maintaining baseline rigor:
- **Allowed:** Custom agents for Minecraft-specific features
- **Allowed:** Additional evidence types (3D renders)
- **Required:** Binary proof regardless of type
- **Required:** Evidence storage in standard structure

## 8. Next PMO Review Triggers

Review required when:
- Evidence collection framework implemented
- First capability proven with evidence
- Regression detected and handled
- Deployment attempted

---

**PMO Verdict:** Project requires significant remediation to meet organizational standards. Current approach relies on estimates rather than evidence. Immediate implementation of project-baseline methodology required.

**Compliance Path:**
1. Implement evidence collection
2. Convert to binary tracking
3. Create verification agents
4. Standardize documentation
5. Prove compliance with evidence
